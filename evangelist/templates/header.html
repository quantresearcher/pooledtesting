<h1>How to test a million people for COVID-19 without a million test kits</h1>

<p>One of the most effective ways of stopping the transmission of COVID-19 is testing - identifying those who have the disease and isolating them before they can potentially infect others. However, the number of people who can be tested at any point in time is very small compared to the size of the population due to testing resources being in short supply. Thus, testing in most countries has only been carried out on those people with enough symptoms or on close contacts of those who have already tested positive. This means that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers are untested and putting everyone else at risk. A potential solution to this problem is <b>pooled testing</b>.</p>

<p>Pooled testing involves combining samples taken from several people and then testing this combined sample using just one test. If the test is negative, this means that no one in the pool is infected. But if the test is positive, then each person in the pool will need to be retested individually. As a concrete example, suppose there are 50 people and only one of them has COVID-19. Normally you would carry out 50 tests - one for each person. But if you divide those people into five pools of 10 and use one test per pool, then four tests will come back negative and you will have ruled out 40 people with just four tests. For the remaining pool (which would have tested positive), each person in it will need to be retested individually, but in the end you will have used just 15 tests instead of 50. As long as the prevalence of the disease is low, pooled testing will lead to a reduction in the number of tests required. But what is the pool size that will lead to the greatest reduction in the number of tests required? That depends primarily on the <b>prevalance</b> of the disease and the <b>correlation</b> of infection among people and, to a lesser extent, on the <b>sensitivity</b> (true positive rate) and <b>specificity</b> (true negative rate) of the test.</p>
